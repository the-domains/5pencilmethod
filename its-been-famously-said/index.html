This will be useful in an upcoming step.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>What types of pencils work the best? </p><p>Here’s a review.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Now, the first major visual rule is this:  Everything that is not flat (meaning that it has more than one dimension) is constantly changing in value.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Take the horse’s face, for example. As the light source strikes the face, that spot is going to be brightly lit. But as the shape of the face turns, it will  progressively darker.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>This happens because the face is contoured (or gently rounded), and more and more light is blocked as that contour curves farther away from where the light is shining.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Since a horse is anything but flat, values will be constantly shifting, getting darker or lighter, as the light confronts changes in contour. A fancy term for this is “gradient.”</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>It looks like this...</p><p><b><br><br></b></p><p>So, at every step along the way, we want to create and maintain “gradient,” or contour, in our drawings. Otherwise, they will become flat and lifeless!</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Take a look at these reference images and see if you can spot all of the “contour” in them...  </p><p><b><br><br></b></p><p>NOTE: Get the printable version of these reference images emailed to you</p><p> so you can follow along with the upcoming steps.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Since you’re working with white paper, the first pencil marks will appear much darker and have contrast with the paper right away. So, in order to accomplish this constant gradation, we need to start adding the first pencil strokes in the darkest places. This allows you to maintain the correct balance between light and dark from the start.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>In other words…</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>If you were to start by adding value in a brightly lit, highlighted area, that value would be darker than the white of the paper. You’d have dark in a light place, and the darker places would all still be white (the paper color.)</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>In other words, your drawing would start with the values </p><p>out of balance</p><p>. It would set up all kinds of optical illusions that make it much harder to end up with a great result.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Did you get all of that? </p><p><b><br></b></p><p>I know that’s a bit of a brain teaser, so let’s put it another way, too... </p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Since value (darkness and lightness) is </p><p>relative</p><p> to its surroundings, any value that you put down first is going to appear to be the darkest place in your drawing!</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>That means that it’s much easier (and safer on your drawing) to start adding your first value (even though it’s a light value) in the dark areas and then progressively work out into the lighter areas of your drawing.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>It’s a process of building up the layers to “stay in balance.” As you add each layer in the following steps, you will continue to increase the value in these dark areas first to maintain the balance.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>So here’s the first thing to do with your HB pencil...</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>After locating one of the darkest portions of the drawing within your layout, start laying down your pencil strokes in the same direction as a portion of the outline you created in step 1, repeating and blending strokes until the layout line becomes a part of this gradient “patch” you’re drawing.</p><p><b><br><br></b></p><p>Take note of how I’ve started my strokes in the darkest place under the lip and moved over the contour on the lip, getting lighter (reducing the pressure on my pencil) as I move out of the shadow.</p><p><b><br><br></b></p><p>You will need to repeat this process in each of the darkest portions of your drawing. It’s a lot easier to see exactly where the darkest places are if you look at the lightest version of the reference images that I provided. By lifting the exposure, you can see that any place that still retains its shadow has to be dark!</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>In the ears, you can see that I’m not necessarily sticking with my traditional stroke. I want to build up the value, but the short, mix-matched hairs are going in all directions. For this, I used more of a crosshatching technique to overlap strokes and create a nicely textured dark value.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Remember, you are moving from dark to light . Lighten the pressure of your pencil on the paper as you move away from your initial strokes and closer to the highlights. This is where my mantra of “lighter, lighter, lighter” comes into play.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Here’s a video to show you how this concept plays out:</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>[ Embed video here... </p><p>https://youtu.be/u947MgiUwOI</p><p> ]</p><p><b><a href="https://youtu.be/u947MgiUwOI"></a><br></b></p><p>Now, what do you do when you need to cover a greater area than the length of your pencil strokes?</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>This video shows you how to connect your strokes and patches of value to create seamless coverage:</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>[ Embed video here... </p><p>https://youtu.be/tW8aPSdflqY</p><p> ]</p><p><b><a href="https://youtu.be/tW8aPSdflqY"></a><br></b></p><p>Repeat this step in all of the darkest portions of your drawing.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Only extend the value out from the shadow as far as the value goes for that contour.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Always use a light touch so that your pencil lines can still be erased. (You’ll see more about why coming up.) </p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Blend the edges of each “patch” together.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Fill in the gaps to make sure that each patch stays as smooth as possible.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Here’s where the saying that “professionals are just those who have mastered the basics” really rings true. None of this is really </p><p>that </p><p>hard.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>And yet</p><p>...</p><p>you can perfect your drawing game for years to come just by improving your skills on this one basic exercise.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>And don’t let that discourage you! </p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Because even if you feel you can do this only at a very basic level, this technique can give you surprisingly great results .</p><p><b><br><br></b></p><p>Step 3:  Begin drawing the fur using this trick</p><p>.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Here’s the one thing most people don’t know that messes them up when drawing fur (and also hair and grass.) </p><p><b><br></b></p><p>The secret is that you don't draw the hairs; you draw the spaces between the hairs!</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>If each pencil stroke represented a hair, you’d have a huge mess of dark “spaghetti noodle” lines. But, if you look at the hair as a whole, you will start to see “groupings” or “clusters” of light hair, divided by those darker gaps you can see in the reference. </p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Your job is to draw those </p><p>gaps</p><p>, which in turn will create the groupings of hair and create the illusion of volume!</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>The strands of hair are the LIGHT parts, and it’s the spaces between the hairs that are DARK. Read that again. It’s really important!</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>[diagram]</p><p><b><br><br></b></p><p>Even in the first layer of strokes, we are already seeing a pattern that resembles fur because the dark lines (the pencil strokes) are in a shape that feels like they could be between hairs.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>It will even get a lot more impressive in the next steps!</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Fun facts: </p><p><b><br></b></p><ul><li>There are occasions when individual light hairs will actually be drawn (erased, really), such as when you have stray hairs falling over the horse’s face or a dark background with light hair in front of it. (We’ll cover this in a bit.)</li><li>It is also true that a hair will be darker if it’s over a lighter background, such as stray hairs sticking out over a light background or where part of a scalp is showing through or a dark hair overlaps a patch of light hairs, for instance.</li></ul><p><b></b></p><p>So what does this mean for drawing fur?</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Well, let’s just logically think about what kind of shape would be created between groups of hairs that start next to each other and go out in different directions. (Remember, the dark part is </p><p>between </p><p>the hairs.)</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Can you visualize that shape? (Hint: you can look at that last image.)</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>This space is a sort of upside down “V” shape, isn’t it? And with the fairly short fur hair that covers a horse’s face, can you imagine how this would create quite a lot of small, upside down “V” shapes throughout the fur?</p><p><b><br><br><br></b></p><p>Now, remember in step 2 where we talked about contour and how that creates the “shape” of an object?</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Well, another technique for creating the shape of the horse (which is an illusion, of course, since it’s all done on a flat sheet of paper) is the direction and length of the hairs within the coat of fur.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Take a good look at how the hairs change direction as the shape of this horse’s head changes…</p><p><b><br><br><br></b></p><p>Notice how the hairs get shorter and change direction as we look toward the side of the face—as part of the face moves farther away from our view—rather than looking at it straight on.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Can you imagine how the apparent direction of those hairs would change as we looked at this horse’s head from different positions?</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>For now, you can just remember to pay attention to the direction, length, and shape of the fur patterns you see in the </p><p>reference photos</p><p> and follow those in your drawing.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>The exciting thing that will happen for you is that the more you notice these things and apply them in your drawings, the more you will build up a “library” in your head so you’ll have a strong grasp of how the visual world works and how to naturally create these illusions in </p><p>any</p><p> of your drawings.</p><p><b><br><br></b></p><p>Step 4:  “Cast a tone” to add dimension to the fur</p><p>.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>We now get to the reason for using the HB pencil in our previous steps.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>But first…if you’re like most of my new students, you probably feel that drawing a realistic, 3-dimensional object on a flat sheet of paper could be done by simply scrubbing in graphite quickly with the side of your pencil, then adjusting your pencil pressure to go lighter or darker until the drawing is all “filled” up. Then, with a tortillion (blending stump), you could smooth out and blend all of that graphite as you see fit.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>(Some folks do draw this way, but I find it messy and prone to error and that it never creates the realistic textures that artists can achieve by drawing in layers.)</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>The HB pencil is dark and soft enough that we can use a very soft, natural-hair brush (I like a 2” inch camel-hair) to lightly smooth over the hair textures created in graphite in order to “cast a tone.”</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>This works because the brush picks up a very small amount of the graphite from the darker areas and evenly covers the surrounding paper with a very even, light layer of graphite. This method prevents smashing down the “tooth” (the tiny ridges in the paper that hold graphite) of your paper, as you’re prone to do if using a tortillion. </p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Get a free 2” camel-hair brush mailed to you</p><p> (if you’ll just buy the stamps).</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>So what has learning how to “cast a tone” done for us? As we said in step 3, hair comes in groups. Those groups are made up of many hairs lying on top of each other.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>That means that you can see…</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>...the second layer of hair under the top layer...</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>...and the third layer under the second layer…</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>...and the fourth layer under the third layer…</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>...until there are enough layers of hair that you can’t see down any further.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Now think of this first layer of fur we just drew on the paper as that last visible layer—the one on the bottom.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>When we brushed this layer to “cast a tone,” it caused the hairs to become softer and have less contrast. This same thing happens to the appearance of hairs in a layer of fur that have several more layers of hair on top, which are blocking the light.f</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>So we are now ready to create a beautifully realistic fur texture in the next steps.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Step 5:  Create highlights in fur using an eraser</p><p>.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>The beauty of always using a light-enough touch with your pencil is that you can easily “draw white” with an eraser.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>For this you’ll need an eraser that is thin enough and stiff enough to remove hairs. (Remember that the hairs are the </p><p>lighter </p><p>part!)</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>There are a couple of different ways to do this.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>A large kneaded eraser is one option. This is a must-have tool for drawing in graphite. I form it into a “tear drop,” which allows it to be used for a variety of situations.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>[ image tear drop kneaded eraser (some on file, I think) ]</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>[embed video: How to form and use your kneaded eraser]</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>I’ve also used an electric eraser for “reversing out” the very fine lines.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>However, in the last couple of years I’ve switched to an eraser called the Tombow Mono Zero. I’ve found that it has some big advantages. One of the biggest is that it’s much closer to the size of a pencil. Plus, it’s a rather inexpensive tool compared to an electric eraser, which costs $100 or more.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>[ image Tombow Mono Zero ]</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>[embed video: How to use the Tombow Mono Zero]</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Of course, most of the time we won’t try to take out the width of a single hair with this eraser. Drawing </p><p>every</p><p> individual hair would be crazy!</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Rather, we will emphasize light groupings of hair like this…</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>]</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Now we do want to show a </p><p>few</p><p> individual hairs within the texture of our horse’s fur coat. This is one of those “magic tricks” that makes the mind think it sees more than what’s really there.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>As you can see below, by showing </p><p>some</p><p> of the hairs (in this case extending outside the bottom edge of the mouth), it feels like we can see all of the individual hairs, even though we are really just using light and shadow to create “groups” of hair.</p><p><b><br><br><br></b></p><p>Step 6:  Continue adding “fur” layers.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Back in step 4, we talked about how fur is a complex structure because the hairs all lie on top of other hairs.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>To create this illusion, we are going to continue repeating steps 3, 4, and 5 several times on top of each other to build up the complexity of the fur. You won’t draw </p><p>entirely</p><p> new layers of hair on top.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>But as you add more graphite into the darker areas, brush that graphite out over the lighter areas you’ve made with your eraser, then add in new highlights. You’ll start to see a sort of magical “depth” appear within the coat of fur.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>This happens because the light “hairs” that you created with your eraser are getting just a smidge darker when you “cast a tone” with your brush. The new light hairs then stand out and appear to be in the forefront of your drawing.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Of course, as you continue adding layers, your drawing will also get darker overall—or “increase in value,” to put it into drawing terms.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>As this happens, you must pay special attention in order to not only create a “dark and light” pattern within the fur, but also to build a general contour over the entire fur texture. In other words, portions of the fur that are within the shadows will </p><p>all </p><p>be darker, and portions in the highlights will </p><p>all </p><p>be lighter.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Of course, it’s possible that a light hair in the shadows could be darker than a shadow between hairs within a highlight. But it might not look like it...</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Notice in the illustration below that although the two values within the small squares appear to be nearly identical when viewed within the circle, the background at the top is actually </p><p>much</p><p> lighter than the line on the bottom when they are isolated in the squares.</p><p><b><br><br></b></p><p>That’s another one of those clever visual rules that helps you master the skill of drawing as you learn how to use it.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Now as you continue to add layers of graphite between the hairs, gently brush the entire area with your soft-bristled brush. Then, as you add in the highlights with your eraser, you’ll see the fur texture gain a complexity that would have made your head spin if you’d had to draw it outright. </p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Yet, using this simple technique, an incredible fur texture is actually fairly easy to create.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>This is how far I’ve built up the fur texture at this stage in my drawing…</p><p><b><br><br><br></b></p><p>Step 7:  Draw the mane.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Here’s where the similarities to drawing straight human hair are almost uncanny!</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>This is awesome, because any time one skill can help you draw not only the project at hand, but also future works of art, you’re maximizing your learning!</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Of course, since the mane </p><p>is</p><p> hair, we’re going to follow many of the same principles and practices that I just laid out for drawing the fur. Those light portions are the actual groups of hair, and the dark gaps you see are the shadow areas between the hairs (or groups of hair, depending on the shape, contrast, and contour of the shadow).</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>This is very important to keep in mind as you think of what shapes you’re drawing.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>The dark gaps you’ll draw with your 2B pencil need to be the “static” shapes that would be created between hairs and locks of hair. The light portions will be the “flowing,” lifelike locks of hair that you’ll draw with a loose, graceful stroke.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>This is true of blonde hair, black hair, and every color in between. The main thing that will change for different hair colors is the contrast between the dark and the light areas.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>You may want to watch this two-part video, where I give an in-depth demonstration of how using a tapered stroke works together with these principles to create the incredible illusion of voluminous hair!</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>[ embed this </p><p>https://youtu.be/bpMZ8bo1Jz8</p><p> ]</p><p></p><p>Another important thing to keep in mind as you draw the mane is that the hair is </p><p>not</p><p> plastered to the face and fur!</p><p><b><a href="https://youtu.be/bpMZ8bo1Jz8"></a><br></b></p><p>You know this to be true from experience. Your hair doesn’t grow out out of your scalp and meld seamlessly to your forehead and face; there is space between the two. This “dimension” between head and hair is a powerful opportunity to create 3D realism in your work.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>So, as you draw the mane, be sure to show that the hair sits above the face, blocking the light and casting a shadow on the fur below. This can be achieved simply by increasing the value of the texture beneath the hair. Here’s an example of what it looks like:</p><p><b><br><br></b></p><p>As you draw the mane, keep returning to your soft brush as you build each layer in order to create depth the same way you did with the fur.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Here’s the mane after completing this stage in my drawing…</p><p><b><br><br><br></b></p><p>Step 8:  Add “character” and balance</p><p>.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>With the mane drawn, you have an incredibly fun and exciting opportunity to make some BIG improvements with just a few small adjustments!</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Let’s start by picking up your eraser:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"></p><p>Kneaded</p><p></p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"></p><p>Elastic-polymer</p><p></p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"></p><p>Tombow Mono Zero</p><p></p></li><li dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"></p><p>Electric</p><p></p></li></ul><p><b></b></p><p>Any one will do; the important thing is to create a sharp, precision edge.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Now, we’re going to emphasize a few highlights in the hair by “drawing” them with the eraser.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Locate a grouping of hair (the light parts from the earlier steps) and carefully run your eraser along the length of that grouping to pick out and emphasize a bright strand of hair. You’ll need to angle your eraser so you’ll have the sharpest edge and greatest control to ensure that your line is thin and subtle.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Now you can see why it’s so important to use your brush to spread extra graphite into the light areas!</p><p><b><br><br></b></p><p>Repeat this process to continue increasing the dimension in the hair; but remember, this is meant to enhance—not distract—from the mane. By adding too many highlights, you will start to lose the subtle contrast and dimension that you’ve been working so hard to achieve.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>This same procedure is how you can make those great-looking strands of stray hair that fall across the face and add a whole new level of depth!</p><p><b><br><br></b></p><p>To create those, simply start your eraser stroke at the end of the current mane and run downward along the face. </p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Have fun with these strokes!</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>You can see that those stray hairs aren’t just straight and rigid. They are windblown and fancy-free, so lighten up on your eraser and “go with the flow.”</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Again, you aren’t trying to draw every single stray hair; just add a few for emphasis!</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Here are some places I chose to add some “character” with the whiskers. Have fun and play around with what you think looks best!</p><p><b><br><br></b></p><p>When you’re done adding your eraser strokes, you can use your brush once again to spread graphite back into the white space that you just created. That may seem counterproductive, but the bright white of the newly revealed paper can be glaringly bright compared to your other highlights. </p><p><b><br></b></p><p>So, in order to keep a proper balance, you’ll want to tone down the white just a bit. But don’t worry; this won’t destroy the effect you’ve created.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>There’s one final place where a small adjustment with your eraser can make a huge difference...</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>The eyes!</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>The eyes in this reference are pretty heavily concealed by the mane, so you aren’t really seeing the gleam in this horse’s eye.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>That’s an important detail to capture in your drawing. It’s going to make the eyes stand out and “pop off” of the page, while also helping you to show that they are contoured.</p><p><b><br><br><br><br></b></p><p>Step 9:  Emphasize and refine your highlights and shadows for the “POP.”</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Sure, those “character” elements and balance that you just worked on really pumped your drawing up in a big way. But here’s where things can really come alive! </p><p><b><br></b></p><p>This step comes down to one simple idea:  contrast.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Why? </p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Because contrast is how the effects of light are indicated in an image. And lighting effects are one of the largest contributors to creating mood.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>All throughout the drawing process, you have been paying attention to where the darkest (and lightest) parts of the image are as a whole. We talked about that back in step 6.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Now you should analyze your drawing and locate the value “extremes”!</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>By extremes, I’m simply suggesting that you find the absolute darkest and lightest places on your drawing and enhance them for emphasis.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>In most cases, the pupils in the eyes will be the darkest part of your drawing. Conversely, the highlight or glisten in the eye that you created in step 8 is typically the brightest.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Any guess what that does?</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>You got it! It creates the most contrast. By putting the brightest value next to the darkest, you’ve made the eyes a strong focal point because high contrast demands a viewer’s attention.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>For the other dark “extremes,” see if you can spot the “shadows within the shadows,” or those deepest, darkest reaches of the reference where the shadows are strongest.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>In the case of this horse, perhaps it would be within the dark gaps between the hairs, which also happen to appear where the darkest shadows are being cast.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Think about all of the spaces that light would have the hardest time shining into and illuminating.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Now, for the highlights, look at where the light is hitting the horse and find those few spots reflecting it the strongest. Those are your light “extremes.”</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Remember to be precise and deliberate. We’re not just scribbling anything in willy-nilly! These adjustments, though meant to enhance, can quickly and easily become distractions. Don’t forget to keep the contour, dark-to-light effect going even at this stage.</p><p><b><br><br></b></p><p>Step 10:  Sign your name and seal it with fixative.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Now that you’ve put so much work into your drawing, you certainly don’t want to ruin it with a signature that throws things out of balance!</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>That’s why I suggest that you sign your name on a piece of scrap paper, cut it out, and move your signature around your drawing to find the spot where it best compliments your overall composition.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Once you’ve added your John Hancock and are sure there aren’t any more refinements that you can make, it’s time to seal the graphite with workable fixative.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>You might be asking, “What is workable fixative”? Good question…</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Workable fixative is a clear, liquid enamel that comes in an aerosol can. When sprayed on your drawing, it dries and creates a protective barrier that keeps graphite on the paper and dirt, dust, and smudges off.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>This protection is hugely helpful, but also fairly permanent, so you’ll want to be sure that you are completely satisfied with your work before applying.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>First, you’ll want to do a quick test spray away from your paper so you can rule out any defects or blockage in the spray nozzle.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Then, hold the can about 12 inches away from your paper and in a quick, smooth, side-to-side motion, mist the entire paper with a light coat of fixative.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Now, stop and let the first layer dry, so as not to create any puddles or bleeds. When the first coat feels dry, repeat the process, allowing the fixative to dry between each coat.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Dab your drawing with a clean tissue after each coat to see if any graphite comes off. When the tissue reveals no new graphite, you know that you have thorough coverage.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>[ final image ]</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>And that’s it!</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>You’re now ready to frame and hang your masterpiece!</p><p><b><br><br></b></p><p>[ turn to ebook and have “email it to me” option ]</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>[ last LGM CTA: which one is best?

Otherwise, they will go flat!</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>We also must start adding the first pencil strokes in the darkest places. This is because graphite pencil marks will always be darker than the white paper and so in order to always have the correct balance between the dark areas and the light areas, we have to make sure that the darkest areas begin getting darker first.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>So here’s the first thing to do with your HB pencil...</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Laying pencil strokes next to each other, go from dark to light.

Here’s the secret: each strand of hair is the LIGHT part and it’s the spaces between the hair that are DARK. Read that again, because it’s just that important! (It </p><p>is</p><p> true that a hair will be darker if it’s over a lighter background such as where part of a scalp is showing through.) So now, creating a “V”-shaped pattern of strokes, draw the fur while thinking of it as drawing the spaces between each hair in the horse’s coat of fur. Be sure to pay attention to the direction the hair is growing and how it changes direction as it wraps around the shape of the horse.</p><p><b><br><br><br><br></b></p><p>Step 4) “Cast a tone” for “backing out” fur highlights</p><p> — </p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Now we get to the reason for using the HB pencil in our previous steps.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>But first… if you’re like most of my students, it probably feels like drawing a realistic, 3-dimensional object on a flat sheet of paper would be done by simply adding pencil strokes that are the correct “darkness” (that’s called value) until the drawing is all “filled” up. </p><p><b><br></b></p><p>(Some folks do draw this way, but I find it tedious, error prone and difficult to get the realistic textures that drawing in layers can create.)</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>The HB pencil is dark and soft enough so that we can use a very soft natural-hair brush (I like the 2” or 2.5” inch camel-hair) to lightly brush over the hair textures created in graphite. The brush picks up a very small amount of the graphite from the darker areas and evenly covers the surrounding paper with a very smooth, light layer of the graphite.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>This is what I call “casting a tone”.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Get a free camel-hair brush mailed to you, if you’ll just buy the stamps</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>So what has this done for us? As we said in step 3, hair comes in groups. Those groups are made up of many hairs laying on top of each other. </p><p><b><br></b></p><p>That means that you can see…</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>...the second layer of hair under the top layer...</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>...and the third layer under the second layer…</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>...and the fourth layer under the third layer…</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>...until there are enough layers of hair that you can’t see down any further.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>So now think of this first layer of fur that we just drew on the paper as that last visible layer — the one on the bottom.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>When we brushed this layer to “cast a tone”, it caused the fur hairs to become softer and have less contrast, just like would happen to the appearance of hairs in a layer of fur that have several more layers of hair on top that are blocking the light.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>This has set us up for creating a beautifully realistic fur texture in the next steps.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Step 5) Create highlights in fur with eraser</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>The beauty of always using a light enough touch with your pencil is that you can easily “draw backwards” with an eraser. </p><p><b><br></b></p><p>For this you’ll need an eraser that is thin enough and stiff enough to remove hairs. (Remember that the hairs are the </p><p>lighter </p><p>part!)</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Of course, most of the time we won’t be trying to take out just the width of a single hair. Drawing </p><p>every</p><p> individual hair would be crazy!</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Rather, we will be emphasizing light groupings of hair like this…</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>[image before/after]</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Now we do want to show a </p><p>few</p><p> individual hairs within the texture of our horse’s fur coat. This is one of those “magic tricks” that makes the mind think it sees more than is really there.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>As you can see, by just showing </p><p>some</p><p> hairs, it still feels like we can see a individual hairs, even though we are really just using light and shadow to create “groups” of hair.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>[image]</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Step 6) Continue adding “fur” layers </p><p><b><br><br><br></b></p><p>Fur is a complex structure because the hairs all lay on top of other hairs so that you can see under layers of hair under more layers until the there are enough layers that you can’t see any deeper. </p><p><b><br></b></p><p>To create this illusion with paper and pencil, continue repeating steps 3, 4 and 5 on top of each other to build up the complexity of the fur.</p><p><b><br><br></b></p><ol><li>Continue adding “fur” layers — Fur is a complex structure because the hairs all lay on top of other hairs so that you can see under layers of hair under more layers until the there are enough layers that you can’t see any deeper. To create this illusion with paper and pencil, continue repeating steps 3, 4 and 5 on top of each other to build up the complexity of the fur.</li><li>Mane — Of course, since the mane is hair, it follows the same trait as the fur: the light parts are the hairs and the dark is the area between the hairs. This is important to keep in mind as you think of what shapes to draw in the hair. Dark parts need to be the shapes that would be created between hairs and locks of hair and the light parts will be how the hairs or locks of hair would flow. This is true of “blonde” hair, “black” hair, and every hair in between. The main thing that will change for different hair colors is the contrast between the dark and the light areas. </li><li>Add “character” and balance — Flyaway hairs, the gleam in the eye, the...</li><li>Emphasize and refine your highlights and shadows for the “POP” — Here’s where things can really come alive! Remember to be precise and deliberate. We’re not just scribbling anything in willy-nilly! And you have to keep the contour, dark-to-light thing going even at this stage. </li><li>Sign your name and seal it with fixative like this — Now that you’ve put all this work into your drawing, you certainly don’t want to ruin it with a signature that throws things out of balance! That’s why you need to sign your name on a different sheet of paper, cut it out and move it around your drawing to find the best composition. Once you’ve added your John Hancock and are sure there aren’t any more refinements that you can make, it’s time to seal the graphite in with fixative. You’ll want to spray about 12 inches away in a quick smooth motion so as not to create any puddles or bleeds. Go back and forth and up and down overlapping each pass just slightly to get an even coverage. </li></ol><p><b></b></p><p>Normally I start with a 4H pencil for this step, but since we’re drawing hair and fur, we’re going to use the softer HB pencil to begin (I’ll share more about this technique in step 3). We’re introducing value togoing into the darkest places, sSo you’ll usetake your HB pencil to draw patches of value that subtly shift go from dark to light—a gradation, if you will. </p><p><b><br></b></p><p>To start this process, you will need to locate a dark portion of the subject reference—the eyes, nose, inner ears, lips, and areas around the chin and neck.  When you’ve chosen your starting point, sStart your pencil strokes parallel to your next to an outline from step 1, repeating and blending strokes until themaking the layout line becomes a part of the patch. </p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Remember, Always begin each of these patches with the darkest value you can create get with your pencil while still leaving the ability to erase if the need arises. and still erase the line (do some practice on a scrap paper to fine tune the pressure needed.).

In other words, where the lightest areas are in your image. </p><p><b><br></b></p><p>We’re not worrying about making it look like fur yet. Just go for a smooth contour. Again, the areas covered in this stageThese areas include the shadows in the nostrils, the mouth, shadows cast by the locks of hair in the mane, the eyes, and the darkest side of the horse.   [Register for this guide for drawing smooth contours]</p><p><b></b></p></div></section></div><section id="2" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="15"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="16"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="17"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="18"><span data-reactid="19"><!-- react-empty: 20 --><h2 data-reactid="21"><a data-reactid="22"></a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="24"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="25"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="26"></div></section></div></div>

This is important to keep in mind as you think of what shapes to draw in the hair. Dark parts need to be the shapes that would be created between hairs and locks of hair and the light parts will be how the hairs or locks of hair would flow. This is true of “blonde” hair, “black” hair, and every hair in between. The main thing that will change for different hair colors is the contrast between the dark and the light areas. </li><li>Add “character” and balance — Flyaway hairs, the gleam in the eye, the...</li><li>Emphasize and refine your highlights and shadows for the “POP” — Here’s where things can really come alive! Remember to be precise and deliberate. We’re not just scribbling anything in willy-nilly! And you have to keep the contour, dark-to-light thing going even at this stage. </li><li>Sign your name and seal it with fixative like this — Now that you’ve put all this work into your drawing, you certainly don’t want to ruin it with a signature that throws things out of balance! That’s why you need to sign your name on a different sheet of paper, cut it out and move it around your drawing to find the best composition. Once you’ve added your John Hancock and are sure there aren’t any more refinements that you can make, it’s time to seal the graphite in with fixative. You’ll want to spray about 12 inches away in a quick smooth motion so as not to create any puddles or bleeds. Go back and forth and up and down overlapping each pass just slightly to get an even coverage. </li></ol>","src":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"metadata":{"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"starred":false,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"keywords":[]}},{"id":"15a269d0-3090-4bb1-9c7e-56d5048769ab","item":"d2e47584-5e4f-473f-92c0-98fa8f9b9667","type":"text","html":"<p><b></b></p>","src":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"metadata":{"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"starred":false,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"keywords":[]}},{"id":"e1193fc0-f654-40e6-b596-0666d565afb5","item":"d2e47584-5e4f-473f-92c0-98fa8f9b9667","type":"text","html":"<p>Normally I start with a 4H pencil for this step, but since we’re drawing hair and fur, we’re going to use the softer HB pencil to begin (I’ll share more about this technique in step 3).
